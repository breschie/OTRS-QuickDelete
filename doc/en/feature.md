## Move in the junk queue

With this package, tickets can be moved to the junk queue in the ticket view with one click of the mouse.
If you have defined a different junk queue, it can also be set in [SysConfig](config.md).

## GenericAgent Job

Currently, a job for final ticket deletion must be added manually.
In future versions of this package, a job to delete the junk tickets will be created.
